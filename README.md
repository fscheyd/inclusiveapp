# Inclusive App

## Purpose

In the world many people experience disabilities to many varying degrees. Some people struggle with walking, some have more of an issue with social interaction, others, like me have problems with being able to hear. These are things that people can't change, yet people still have to go on with their lives. Often that involves interacting with different businesses. Not every business offers the same level of accesibility to everyone. Which is why I've created this app. This app is to allow people who desire a more accesible experience to rate and review business, in hopes of giveing disabled individuals a choice in where they might want to take their patronage.

Right now, the app is on a base level where users can:

- Sign up
- Input a new business
- View already submitted busnisses
- Write, edit, delete reviews about a business
- Read other's reviews about businesses
- And view the businesses by rank on a scale of 1 to 5 for accesibility

## Installation

Step 1: Open terminal and input command:
```git clone git@github.com/fscheyd/inclusiveapp.git```

Step 2: Enter the directory by inputting in the terminal:
```cd inclusive-app```

Step 3: Make sure to run ```bundle install``` so all of the appropriate gems are installed.

Step 4: Run the program with the command:
```rails s```

Step 5: Finally the localhost url should appear, which should be ```localhost:3000```. enter that into your browser and play around and rate your businesses.  

## Future Functions

The hope is to make this a fully integrated app that sources data from sites such as yelp, google, facebook, etc. and pre-populates the list of busnesses available for review. There also will be a more comprehensive review form with more specific attributes like sound proofing, wheelchair accesability, flashing lights or other aspects of photo-sensitivity. The final stretch goal would be to make this available for devices.
